# rock-paper-scissors-python
Experience rock paper scissors in a whole new way, not against a human, but against AI.


On the user's side :

Type the letters r, p, s or q for rock, paper, scissors and quit respectively. 


AI :

I have assigned a number to each rock(1), paper(2) and scissors(3).

Using the random.randint(1,3) function(imported from random), the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 and 3(both inclusive) at the start of each round.

The shell then displays the choice assigned to the randomly chosen number.

At the end of each round, the computer displays the number of times you won, loss or tied with the computer.

After you quit(press q) it shows whether you won, lost or tied with the AI.

For exiting the shell, I used the sys.exit() function by importing sys.


I hope you enjoy:)
